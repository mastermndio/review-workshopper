# Arrays

What's better than 1? More than 1! Lets practice working with some collections.

Create a new file called `4-arrays.js`

# 1. Create an array

Create an array that will hold the following fruits
- Grapes
- Bannana
- Kiwi
- Lime
- Grapefruit
- Avacado

# 2. How many fruits

Display the number of fruits in the array

# 3. Display the 4th item in the array

Display the 4th fruit in the array

# 4. Replace a fruit

We hate bannanas because their taste overpowers every other fruit in our smoothie. Replace `Bannana` with `Blueberry` at the same location

# 5. Let's ge the first fruit ready to go into the blender. 

Pull the last fruit out of the collection and save it to a variable called `firstFruit`

## 4. Commit your changes

Commit your changes with the message `Array of Sunshine`
