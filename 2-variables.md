# Variables

Variables are awesome!!! Let's use them!

Create a new file called `2-variables.js`

## 1. Create a variable 

Create 3 variables that will hold a color. One for Dave, one for Sarah, and one for Ernesto. Do not assign them values

## 2. Set favorite colors

Without modifying previous code, Set Ernesto's favorite color to `Green`, set Sarah's to `Blue` and set Dave's to `mauve`

## 3. Print this
Using string interpolation or string concatenation display the following

`Ernesto's favorite color is Green`
`Sarah's favorite color is Blue`
`Dave's favorite color is Mauve`

## 4. Fix mistakes

You realize you got everyone mixed up. Without modifying existing code shift the colors around so they are correct.

Ernesto's favorite color is actually Mauve
Sarah loves Green and
Dave is a fan of Blue

## 4. Commit your changes
