# Conditionals

Maybe I will, maybe I won't

`Create a file called `5-conditionals.js`

# 1. Over or under

Create a variable called overOrUnder and set it to any number between 0-100

Write a conditional that will display `Over 50` if the number is greater than 50, or `under 50` if the number is less than 50.

# 2. Over, In Between or Under

Modify your conditional statement to do the following: 

If number is less than 33 display `Bottom Third`. If it is 33-66 display `Middle Third` and if it is greater than 66, display `Top Third`

# 3. More than 100

In the number is less than 0 or greater than 100, display `Outside Third`

## 4. Commit your changes

Commit your changes with the message `On one condition`
