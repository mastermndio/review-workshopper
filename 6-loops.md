# Loops

All in my head, I think about it over and over again...

Create a file called 6-loops.js

# 1. Write a loop that will display the numbers 1-50

Write a loop to print out the nuymbers 1-50

# 2. Break out!

Create a variable before the function and assigb it a value between 1 and 50

Using the "break" keyword, Modify the loop to stop when it gets to the number that is assigned to that veriable.

# 3. Say it

Unsinf the "continue" keyword, only print the number if it is even

## 4. Commit your changes

Commit your changes with the message `On one condition`
