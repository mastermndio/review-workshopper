# Review Workshopper

This workshopper is designed to help you revisit and practice concepts learned throughout the course. It's beenn a while since we've done some of this stuff so you may have to look at old notes, hit up stack overflow or even watch some YouTube videos. It's completely okay to lean on your classmates for answers as well but I challenge you to not copy off of each other. Do as much as you can on your own and practice asking specific questions to get you over your hurdle when you do run into one. Make sure you note concepts youre struggling with so that we can put a plan together after to help you get a handle on them
